🏁 Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow applied to Electric Vehicle (EV) sales in India. By combining Python-based exploratory data analysis with interactive Power BI dashboards, the analysis provides meaningful insights into EV adoption trends, state-wise performance, and vehicle segment dynamics.

The results clearly indicate a strong upward trend in EV adoption, particularly after 2020, driven mainly by 2-Wheelers and 3-Wheelers. States such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu have emerged as key contributors to national EV sales, highlighting regional leadership in electric mobility. The State Deep Dive and Segment & Policy dashboards further enable granular analysis, supporting informed decision-making for policymakers, businesses, and infrastructure planners.

Overall, this project highlights how data-driven insights can support sustainable mobility initiatives, guide EV infrastructure planning, and inform market and policy strategies. The dashboards developed in this project are scalable and can be extended further with forecasting, city-level data, or charging infrastructure information, making this analysis a strong foundation for future EV-focused analytical work.
